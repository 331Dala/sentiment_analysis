I find some dataset from Kaggle, though the data is from 5 years ago,2020.  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets/data  
Let's keep 15 days data.  from oct 15th to oct 31th.  
#### For nltk download error  
`Error:  
[nltk_data] Error loading stopwords: <urlopen error Tunnel connection  
[nltk_data]     failed: 400 Bad Request>  
[nltk_data] Error loading wordnet: <urlopen error Tunnel connection  
[nltk_data]     failed: 400 Bad Request>   `
Workaround:  
Execute in code line:  
`import nltk  
print(nltk.data.path)  `
Select and open one of the responsed directory, create a folder called nltk_data  
Download from https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data?tab=readme-ov-file  
Extract only folder corpora to your path nltk_data  
And then you don't need to download stopwords and wordnet components any more.
